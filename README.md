# MET — Ministry of Enjoyment Taxi 🚕✨

Ministry of Enjoyment Taxi (MET) is a nightlife-focused transport brand built for Nairobi’s night economy.
We don’t just move people — we extend the experience.

This repository contains the official website for MET, including brand presentation, service information, and conversion touchpoints.

## 🌙 About MET

MET operates during peak nightlife hours to provide safe, reliable, and premium party transport for:

- Club-goers
- Young professionals
- Event attendees
- VIP and group bookings

Unlike traditional ride-hailing services, MET is designed specifically for late-night demand, fixed operating windows, and experience-driven transport.

**Tagline:**

Your journey, our party.

## 🧩 Website Purpose

The MET website is built to:

- Present the MET brand and nightlife identity
- Clearly communicate services and operating model
- Convert visitors into bookings and inquiries
- Serve as a reference for partners, venues, and collaborators

This is not the booking backend — it is the public-facing brand and information layer.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

The website is intentionally lightweight and fast.

Typical stack (adjust if needed):

- Frontend: HTML / CSS / JavaScript
- Framework: React / Vite / Next.js
- Styling: TailwindCSS or custom CSS
- Assets: SVG / PNG branding assets
- Deployment: Netlify / Vercel / Static hosting

The site is optimized for mobile-first nightlife users.
